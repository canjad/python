# python
Here is my first project in Python; the files contain the Martian. If you have any questions ask me  

And I will introduce the file to do which function I use basic MVC structure. 

usl.py- that is a view to achieve the project  menu 

bll.py - that is the control file and achieves this project add, delete, revision, inquiry functions

dal.py - to complete the file, read and write 

dtl.py-  It contains information about the outbreak data (such as name, number of new cases, and number of existing cases), and provides methods to interact with this data
